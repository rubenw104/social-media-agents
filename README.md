# social-media-agents
This reposocial-media-agents is a playful and experimental project that uses LangChain, local large language models (LLMs), and various tools to simulate the behavior of an intelligent Instagram account. It autonomously generates and publishes content around fun facts, myth busting, general curiosities, and engaging knowledge-based posts.
